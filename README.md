# Photosite
 
This project creates a MVC(Model-View-Controller) based Ruby on Rails application that implements the concept of Photo Sharing Site. The concepts I have learned by doing this R-AWS project are creating a photosite project on Ruby on Rails locally, creating and using a Docker Container, deploying the Ruby on Rails project into Docker Container and deploying the project to an AWS - EC2 instance through Docker Container.
